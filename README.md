# Next.js on Netlify Platform Starter

[Live Demo](https://nextjs-platform-starter.netlify.app/)

A modern starter based on Next.js 16 (App Router), Tailwind, and [Netlify Core Primitives](https://docs.netlify.com/core/overview/#develop) (Edge Functions, Image CDN, Blob Store).

In this site, Netlify Core Primitives are used both implictly for running Next.js features (e.g. Route Handlers, image optimization via `next/image`, and more) and also explicitly by the user code.

Implicit usage means you're using any Next.js functionality and everything "just works" when deployed - all the plumbing is done for you. Explicit usage is framework-agnostic and typically provides more features than what Next.js exposes.

## Deploying to Netlify

This site requires [Netlify Next Runtime v5](https://docs.netlify.com/frameworks/next-js/overview/) for full functionality. That version is now being gradually rolled out to all Netlify accounts.

After deploying via the button below, please visit the **Site Overview** page for your new site to check whether it is already using the v5 runtime. If not, you'll be prompted to opt-in to to v5.

## Developing Locally

1. Clone this repository, then run `npm install` in its root directory.

2. For the starter to have full functionality locally (e.g. edge functions, blob store), please ensure you have an up-to-date version of Netlify CLI. Run:

```
npm install netlify-cli@latest -g
```

3. Link your local repository to the deployed Netlify site. This will ensure you're using the same runtime version for both local development and your deployed site.

```
netlify link
```

4. Then, run the Next.js development server via Netlify CLI:

```
netlify dev
```

If your browser doesn't navigate to the site automatically, visit [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).
